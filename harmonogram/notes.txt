Harmonogram 
	1. add extra columns that show the total amount of information for each gene in each category of data - genomic, structure, etc. 
	2. add gene search feature that zooms into the matrix or opens up a new window and shows the most similar genes across all categories. 
	3. clicking on a tile should pull up the information behind this tile, possibly in a new window or a pop up. 
	4. Try to make a more powerful canvas version that would allow the visualization of all genes at once. 

Harmonogram notes 6-24-2015

	I think I'll deploy this as a flask app. 
	/v2/apps 8080 

	I've made a lot of improvements to the visualization. It's now very flexible - resizes, handles wide tiles, etc. 

	resource category colors 
		I need to create a color key for the resources and color the tiles. 

	gene/resource search

	I'm going to work on modularizing the visualization code so that I can swap in a canvas for svg and improve the zooming of the original svg visualization.

Harminogram notes 6-10-2015

	I'm loading Andrew's data from his json format into a friendlier json format. I need to then use d3_clustergram.py to generate the visualization json.

	I'll see how I did this in make_enr_clust.py. I start by converting the enrichment data structure to a nodes matrix 

		d3.clustergram.convert_enr_to_nodes_mat( enr )

	I could either store the data in an enrichment-like structure or write slightly modified functions to avoid using an enrichment-like data structure. 

	I'm outputting toy data to visualize.
