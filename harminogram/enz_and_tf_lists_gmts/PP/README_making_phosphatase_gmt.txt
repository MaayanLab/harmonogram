Phosphatase GMT

I made a gene level phosphatase-substrate gmt from data obtained from the publication

Li, X., Wilmanns, M., Thornton, J. & KÃ¶hn, M. Elucidating human phosphatase-substrate networks. Science signaling 6 (2013).

They collected phosphtase-substrate interactions from: "'dephosphorylation' and 'post translational modification' data in the Human protein Reference Database (HPRD); 'dephosphorylation' interaction data in teh PPI databases (PSICQUIC), substrate information from Uniprot annotations, and a literature search using PubMed and Google."

Some protein names had to be converted to gene symbols and phosphatases with fewer than 3 known substrates were omitted from the gmt.
